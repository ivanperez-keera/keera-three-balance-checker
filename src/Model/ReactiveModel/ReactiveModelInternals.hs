-- This module holds the reactive program model. It holds a program model,
-- but includes events that other threads can listen to, so that a change
-- in a part of the model is notified to another part of the program. The
-- reactive model is not necessarily concurrent (it doesn't have its own thread),
-- although a facility is included to make it also concurrent (so that
-- event handlers can be called as soon as they are present).
